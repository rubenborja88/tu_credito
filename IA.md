# AI Usage (IA.md)

AI tools were used as a productivity assistant to:

- Draft initial project scaffolding (file/folder layout suggestions)
- Generate boilerplate code for repeated patterns (DRF ViewSets, basic React pages)
- Cross-check common Django/DRF configuration patterns (JWT, drf-spectacular URLs)

All generated code was reviewed and edited manually. Business rules and validations were implemented intentionally, and the final codebase was validated with Django migrations and basic tests.
